Theme Interpretation
The theme "Ocean and Environment" is interpreted as a call to understand and address various marine environmental issues with global impact. This project focuses specifically on Pacific nations, as the region holds high marine biodiversity but also faces some of the most severe impacts of marine pollution, especially plastic waste. These countries also face unique challenges in conserving marine ecosystems amid limited resources and climate change.

Narrative Presented
The main story presented is how marine pollution has changed over time in Pacific countries, and whether protection efforts such as marine conservation areas have helped reduce pollution levels, especially plastic waste. The visualizations will show countries with the highest pollution, dominant pollution types, and comparisons between pollution levels and the extent of marine protected areas.

Target Audience
•	Environmental students & academics
•	Environmental activists and policy makers
•	General public concerned with marine issues

Type of Visualization: Interactive
•	Map of marine pollution distribution by country
•	Time trend charts by type of pollution
•	Bar charts showing dominant types of pollution
•	Scatter plots comparing plastic pollution and size of protected marine areas
•	Risk map showing high pollution but low protection zones

Tools Used
•	Python (pandas, plotly, openpyxl)
•	Streamlit for interactive dashboards
•	GitHub + Streamlit Cloud for hosting and deployment

Dataset Used
1.	Blue Pacific 2050 Indicators (SPC / Pacific Data Hub)
Source: Pacific Data Hub Statistic – SPC
Direct Link: .Stat Data Explorer • Blue Pacific 2050: Ocean And Environment (Thematic Area 6)
Institution: SPC (Pacific Community)

Data desc:
This is the main dataset used for all visualizations. It contains a collection of sustainable development indicators for Pacific nations, as part of the Blue Pacific 2050 initiative.

Example indicators:
-	SPC_12_4_2: Hazardous Waste Management
-	SPC_14_2_1: Marine and Coastal Management 
-	SPC_15_8_1: Invasive Species Control

Time Coverage: 2013-2023

Reason for selection:
This dataset is an official reference to measure sustainable development progress in the Pacific. Since it comes from SPC, it’s highly relevant for macro-level analysis and cross-country comparisons.

2.	Marine Pollution – Pacific
Source: SPREP – Pacific Environment Portal
Direct Link: https://pacific-data.sprep.org/dataset/marine-pollution-pacific

Data desc:
An informative and documentary dataset that explains major sources of marine pollution, control strategies, and their connections to SDG targets and regional policies.

Reason for selection:
This document provides context and policy references that enrich the interpretation of quantitative data. It also helps map indicators to the SDG agenda.

3.	Marine Pollution Data
Source: SPREP – Pacific Environment Portal
Direct Link: https://pacific-data.sprep.org/dataset/marine-pollution-data

Data desc:
A structured dataset containing numerical or spatial data on marine pollution levels, microplastics, and marine ecosystem risks.

Reason for selection:
This dataset forms the basis for visual exploration because it offers up-to-date data that can be directly used in the interactive dashboard. Its format supports trend analysis and risk evaluation.
